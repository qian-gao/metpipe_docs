# Merge peaklist and map information

Processed peaklist from postive and negative mode are merged into one final peaklist. 

## General procedures

1. Remove redundant compounds   
If certain compound is measured in both positive and negative mode, keep the entry where it has higher mean level in samples.   

2. Map information from library   
Map compound related information, such as HMDB.ID, Molecular.formula, Monoisotopic.mass, KEGG.ID, Smiles, Inchikey and metabolite class, to final output datatable.
