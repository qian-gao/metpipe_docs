# Peak cleaning



### Inspection of blank samples
Metabolomics data are prone to contain artifact signals originating from sources other than the biological matrix under investigation, such as additives and preservatives incorporated during sample collection and processing, ghost peaks derived from sample preparation (e.g., derivatization), impurities present in solvents and reagents, and contaminants coming from labware and the MS system (e.g., plasticizers or column bleeding). Furthermore, these contaminants and other matrix components may accumulate in the instrument (e.g., in the autosampler or in the column) as a result of inadequate washing between sample injections, leading to the appearance of carryover signals from the foregoing samples in subsequent injections. 

Features can be considered as potential contaminant when their mean values in real samples do not exceed three times the mean values detected in blanks.
