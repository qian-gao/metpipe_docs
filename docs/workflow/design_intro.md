# Study design & data organization

Good analysis starts before data acquisition. This section summarizes practical guidance for designing an LC–MS metabolomics/lipidomics study and introduces the data conversion and data structure of LC-MS(/MS) data.

## Overview

- [**Randomization**](design_randomization.md): strategies to minimize confounding technical variation with biological groups.
- [**QC samples setup**](design_qc_setup.md): recommended QC samples (blanks, pooled QCs, internal standards) and their placement in the acquisition sequence.
- [**Data conversion**](design_data_conversion.md): converting vendor raw files to open formats (e.g., mzML).
- [**LC-MS data structure**](design_data_structure.md): understanding the organization and representation of LC-MS(/MS) data, including MS levels, profile vs centroid data, and optional ion mobility.
