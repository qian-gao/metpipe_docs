# Peak grouping

During ionization in data acquisition, an individual chemical compound gives rise to one or more ion species, which can be observed in the same mass spectrum. Those ion species include isotopologue ions, fragment ions, and in particular for electrospray ionization (ESI) adduct and cluster ions.

For biological interpretation, we are mainly interested in the compounds, rather than the redundancy of the different ion species, which induce an undesired bloat in the number of observed features. To address these problems, two additional processing steps are desired for LC/MS data analysis: 

1) Grouping all features which are derived from the same analyte   
2) Annotation of the type of ion species.

## General procedures

### 1. Creating compound spectra based on retention time

### 2. Isotopic peak detection

### 3. Compound spectrum refinement graph

### 4. Annotation of adducts, common neutral losses and cluster-ions
