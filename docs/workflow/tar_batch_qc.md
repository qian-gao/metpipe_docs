# Batch Design and Quality Control (QC)

Batch design and QC principles in targeted metabolomics/lipidomics are largely similar to those in untargeted workflows. For general guidance on sample randomization, pooled QCs, blanks, and batch documentation, see [untargeted QC guidelines](untar_qc.md).

## Key Differences in Targeted QC

- **Calibration standards and calibration QC samples:**
	- Targeted workflows require the inclusion of calibration standards and calibration QC samples in each batch to enable absolute quantification and monitor calibration curve stability.
	- Calibration samples should span the expected concentration range and be injected at appropriate intervals (e.g., beginning, end, and/or throughout the batch).
- **Internal standard (IS) mapping:**
	- Targeted workflows often use a defined mapping of internal standards to specific analytes or classes, and normalization is performed accordingly during data processing.
- **Documentation of calibration and IS performance:**
	- More rigorous tracking and reporting of calibration curve parameters, IS response, and quantification accuracy are expected in targeted workflows.

For all other aspects of batch design and QC, refer to the [untargeted QC documentation](untar_qc.md).
