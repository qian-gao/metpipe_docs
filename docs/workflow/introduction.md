# Introduction

This section provides general guidelines for the computational workflow for metabolomics/lipidomics data processing. 

It will cover the following topics:

General guidelines:
- Randomization of samples before data acquisition
- Quality control (QC) samples and their use
- Data conversion before processing
- LC-MS data structure

Untargeted data processing:
- Retention time prediction
- QC of internal standards
- Preprocessing steps
- Peak grouping
- Peak cleaning
- Missing imputation
- Normalization
- Merge peaklist
