Use the isotope finder for more sensitive detection of possible isotope signals.</p> <p>Isotope pattern finder Isotope pattern finder searches for the isotope signals of selected chemical elements in the mass list of each feature. The isotope pattern detected by the isotope finder module has priority over the one detected by the isotope filter (grouper) module, if both are available. For more details, see the Isotope pattern finder module.</p> <p>Feature alignment Feature alignment enables alignment of corresponding features across all samples.</p> <p>Join aligner This module aligns detected peaks in different samples through a match score. The score is calculated based on the mass and retention time of each peak and ranges of tolerance stipulated in the parameter setup dialog. For more information, see the join aligner module.</p> <p>Gap-filling Absence of features in some samples can either reflect the truth - the metabolite is absent in the given sample, or it can be due to data preprocessing.To account for this, gap filling is applied as the next step.</p> <p>Gap-filling (peak finder) Gap-filling can be performed on the aligned feature lists to cope with missing features that might be artifacts of the feature-detection process. For more details see the Gap-filling (peak finder) module.</p> <p>Export Depending on the downstream analyses, there are several export options which are accessible through Feature list methods \u2192 Export feature list.</p>"},{"location":"workflow/preprocessing/","title":"Preprocessing","text":"<p>In general, the data preprocessing procedure is shown below:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"workflow/preprocessing/#construction-of-eics","title":"Construction of EICs","text":""},{"location":"workflow/preprocessing/#peak-detection","title":"Peak detection","text":""},{"location":"workflow/preprocessing/#issues","title":"Issues:","text":"<ul> <li>Co-eluting metabolites</li> </ul> <p>Example of deconvolution: three overlapping peaks were separated, making use of the mass spectral information.
